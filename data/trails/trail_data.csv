# String trail: projectile ID plus a suffix if there are multiple trails for that proj
# String projectile: projectile ID 
# String sprite: sprite ID in data/config/settings.json: in the "graphics"\"fx" category
# float minLength: minimal segment length. Improve the performance when time warp in involved as well as keeping the look consistent. 
# !!!! Can be set to a negative value to triggers a more optimized SLOW MODE for projectiles with very low speeds. !!!!
# float fadeIn: fade in time in seconds
# float duration: full opacity duration in seconds
# float fadeOut: fadeout time in seconds
# float sizeIn: initial width
# float sizeOut: final width
# Color colorIn: initial color
# Color colorOut: final color
# float opacity: maximum opacity clamp
# float textLength: texture length in pixels
# float textScroll: texture scroll speed in pixels per seconds
# float distance: distance behind the proj the trail spawns
# float dispersion: amount of randomization per second, in su
# float drift: amount of sideway compensation for drifting projectiles
# boolean fadeOnFadeOut: forced fadeout if the proj fades
# boolean angleAdjustment reorient the trail in the direction of the velocity rather than the proj facing. 
# !!!! Must be FALSE for BALLISTIC_AS_BEAM projs !!!!
# boolean additive: normal or additive blending
# float velocityIn: speed at which the trail segments are "emited" at, in su
# float velocityOut: final speed of the trail segments
# float angle: offset angle of the trail relative to the projectile orientation, after corrections if any (default 0 for directly backward)
# float rotationIn: initial angular momentum of the trail segments relative to the projectile
# float rotationOut: final angular momentum of the trail segments
