Added MagicTxt
   . Allows to easily externalize compiled texts in a CSV to help translators.

Added MagicInterferencePlugin
   . Makes exceptionally strong weapons with the "Interference" trait have negative effects when more that one is mounted on a given ship.
   . Those weapons need to trigger the plugin to check for possible other interference sources from a CSV file.
   . If other sources are found, it will add a hullmod that reduced the ship's dissipation depending on the number of interfering weapons and their interference strength.

Added MagicBasicInterferenceEffec loose weapon script to trigger an interference check.

Added MagicIncompatibleHullmods
   . Propose a uniformized "incompatible hullmod" solution.
   . When triggered as two incompatible hullmods are added, it will remove the offending hullmod and add a hullmod to warn the player about that operation.
   . The added hullmod's tooltip will indicate which hullmod was removed and why.

Added MagicModuleRetreatCleaner
   . Fixes the bug with retreating ships with modules preventing the combat from ending.
